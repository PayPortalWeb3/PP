# Why PayPortal? Problems Solved

## The Problem with Traditional Payments

PayPortal solves critical problems that merchants face with traditional payment processors like Stripe, PayPal, and Square.

---

## Problem 1: High Fees

Traditional processors take 2.5-3.5% of every transaction.

| Provider | Fee Structure | Cost on $1,000 |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Stripe | 2.9% + $0.30 | $29.30 |
| PayPal | 3.49% + $0.49 | $35.39 |
| Square | 2.6% + $0.10 | $26.10 |
| Shopify Payments | 2.9% + $0.30 | $29.30 |
| **PayPortal** | **0%** | **$0.00** |

### Annual Savings

| Annual Revenue | Stripe Fees | PayPortal Fees | Savings |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| $50,000 | $1,480 | $0 | $1,480 |
| $100,000 | $2,930 | $0 | $2,930 |
| $500,000 | $14,650 | $0 | $14,650 |
| $1,000,000 | $29,300 | $0 | $29,300 |

## Problem 2: Chargebacks

Customers can dispute transactions and take money back.

| Aspect | Traditional | PayPortal |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Dispute rate | 0.5-1% of transactions | 0% |
| Merchant loses | Product + money + $25 fee | Nothing |
| Fraud liability | On merchant | On customer |
| Reversibility | Up to 120 days | Irreversible |

**Chargebacks cost merchants $125 billion per year globally.**

With blockchain payments:
- Transaction confirmed = payment final
- No disputes, no reversals
- Customer has the crypto or they don't

## Problem 3: Frozen Funds & Holdbacks

Processors hold your money hostage.

| Scenario | Traditional | PayPortal |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| New account | 7-14 day rolling reserve | Instant to wallet |
| "Suspicious" activity | Funds frozen indefinitely | No middleman to freeze |
| Account termination | Funds held 90-180 days | You control the keys |
| Weekend/holiday | No settlement | 24/7/365 settlement |

### Horror Stories (Real Examples)

- PayPal froze $50,000 for 180 days with no explanation
- Stripe terminated account overnight, held funds for 90 days
- Square flagged "suspicious" $5,000 sale, held for 30 days

**With PayPortal:** Funds go directly to your wallet. Instantly. No one can freeze them.

## Problem 4: Restricted Industries

Traditional processors ban entire categories.

### Industries Often Banned

- ❌ Adult content / OnlyFans-style platforms
- ❌ Cannabis / CBD products
- ❌ Online gambling / casinos
- ❌ Cryptocurrency businesses
- ❌ Firearms and ammunition
- ❌ Vaping / e-cigarettes
- ❌ Nutraceuticals / supplements
- ❌ Travel (considered "high risk")
- ❌ Dropshipping (considered "high risk")

## Problem 5: International Payment Friction

Cross-border payments are expensive and slow.

| Aspect | Traditional | PayPortal |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Cross-border fee | 1-2% additional | 0% |
| Currency conversion | 2-4% markup | Customer pays in crypto |
| Settlement time | 3-5 business days | Seconds to minutes |
| Supported countries | Limited list | Global (anyone with internet) |
| Local bank required | Yes | No |

### Real Example

**Freelancer in Nigeria paid $100 by US client:**

| Method | Sent | Received | Lost |
|--------|------|----------|------|
| PayPal | $100 | $91 | $9 (9%) |
| Wise | $100 | $96 | $4 (4%) |
| Bank wire | $100 | $75 | $25 (25%) |
| **PayPortal** | $100 | $100 | $0 (0%) |

---

## Problem 6: Requires Bank Account

Traditional payments need banking infrastructure.

| Requirement | Traditional | PayPortal |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Business bank account | Required | Not needed |
| KYC verification | Required | Permissionless |
| Credit history | Often checked | Not relevant |
| Business registration | Usually required | Not required |
| Approval time | 2-4 weeks | 5 minutes |

**1.7 billion adults globally are unbanked.** They can still use PayPortal.

## Problem 7: Privacy Concerns

Traditional processors track everything.

| Aspect | Traditional | PayPortal |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Transaction tracking | Full history stored | Pseudonymous |
| Data sharing | Sold to third parties | No middleman |
| Government access | Can freeze/seize | Self-custody |
| Purchase history | Logged forever | On-chain only |

---

## Problem 8: Platform Risk

You don't control your payment infrastructure.

| Risk | Traditional | PayPortal |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| ToS changes | Can break your business | You host it |
| Price increases | No recourse | Free forever |
| Feature removal | Accept or leave | Fork the code |
| Acquisition/shutdown | Lose everything | MIT licensed |
